## ChatuRec Legal Status

Our streaming recorder software does not technically violate any law. Of course, it neither intends to infringe on copyright, and it has guidelines for legal use, advertising itself as lawful.

It operates on the same principles as traditional video cassette recorders (VCRs) or digital video recorders (DVRs) but for online content. Just like a VCR allows users to record and save television broadcasts for personal use, our streaming recorder enables users to capture and store streaming content from online platforms.

Much like the time-shifting feature of VCRs, our software allows users to time-shift their viewing experience by recording content for later consumption. Users can record streaming videos for personal use, such as watching at a more convenient time or storing favorite content for future enjoyment.

It's important to highlight that the software is intended for personal use, and users should respect copyright laws. Our software is designed to empower users to manage their digital content in a manner similar to traditional recording devices, promoting convenience and flexibility while respecting the rights of content creators and copyright holders.

An important quote what Consumer Reports say about it is: "These services don’t technically break the law because they aren’t doing anything that circumvents the digital rights management on the video and audio being recorded."

Please be aware that ChatuRec is not accountable for the media content you record. Therefore, we strongly recommend checking the copyright laws applicable in your country and adhering to legal guidelines for video recording.
