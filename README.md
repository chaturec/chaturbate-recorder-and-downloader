## ChatuRec Legal Documents

Our legal documents will be available soon.

## ChatuRec Legal Status

Our streaming recorder software does not technically violate any law. Of course, it neither intends to infringe on copyright, and it has guidelines for legal use, advertising itself as lawful.

It operates on the same principles as traditional video cassette recorders (VCRs) or digital video recorders (DVRs) but for online content. Just like a VCR allows users to record and save television broadcasts for personal use, our streaming recorder enables users to capture and store streaming content from online platforms.

Much like the time-shifting feature of VCRs, our software allows users to time-shift their viewing experience by recording content for later consumption. Users can record streaming videos for personal use, such as watching at a more convenient time or storing favorite content for future enjoyment.

It's important to highlight that the software is intended for personal use, and users should respect copyright laws. Our software is designed to empower users to manage their digital content in a manner similar to traditional recording devices, promoting convenience and flexibility while respecting the rights of content creators and copyright holders.

An important quote what Consumer Reports say about it is: "These services don’t technically break the law because they aren’t doing anything that circumvents the digital rights management on the video and audio being recorded."

Please be aware that ChatuRec is not accountable for the media content you record. Therefore, we strongly recommend checking the copyright laws applicable in your country and adhering to legal guidelines for video recording.

## Legal Video Recording Guidelines

If you want to legally record online videos, please read this important information.

### Legal Considerations

1) It's not illegal to record copyrighted videos for personal use, under the "fair use" or "fair dealing" law.

2) In some cases, it might also be legal to record copyrighted videos for commercial reasons, as long as those reasons are covered by "fair use."

3) While you may be breaking a website's terms of service, there have been no reported cases of users being banned or getting into trouble for this practice.

It's important to note that while the ChatuRec service encourages the lawful recording of non-copyrighted videos, users should exercise caution and diligence to verify the copyright status of the content they choose to record. Additionally, for copyrighted material, obtaining proper authorization or adhering to "fair use" principles is advised to ensure compliance with copyright laws.

### Fair Use and Timeshifting

1) We believe that recording content from video-sharing websites to watch it at another time or on a device without an internet connection has the same purpose as timeshifting and should be considered fair use.

2) This precedent was set in the Betamax case, where recording non-copyrighted videos is deemed entirely legal.

### ChatuRec Service - A modern VCR for Streaming Video

1) The ChatuRec service functions as a modern VCR ("videocassette recorder") for streaming video, allowing users to make their own recordings for private, non-commercial purposes.

2) Recording copyrighted videos for viewing at a more convenient time is permitted by United States copyright law as fair use (See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 1984, the "Sony Betamax Case").

3) Recording copyrighted videos for viewing in a more convenient place is also considered fair use (See Recording Indus. Ass’n of Am. v. Diamond Multimedia Sys., Inc., 180 F.3d 1072, 1999).

4) Users are free to record non-copyrighted videos for personal use, but they should be mindful of copyright status and adhere to local laws.

### Global Fair Use and Fair Dealing Provisions

1) Over 40 countries, representing over one-third of the world's population, have incorporated fair use or fair dealing provisions into their copyright laws.

2) It is crucial to be aware of the copyright law applicable in your country before engaging in any recording activities.

3) We are unable to monitor compliance with "fair use" or "fair dealing" laws in all countries; therefore, it is advisable to verify the applicable regulations in your specific country.

### Legal Status in Different Countries

United States, United Kingdom, and Other Countries with "Fair Use" or "Fair Dealing" Laws:

1) In jurisdictions such as the USA and UK, which have "fair use" or "fair dealing" laws allowing the use of copyrighted material for the purpose of space or time-shifting, it is legally permissible to record copyrighted videos for personal use.

Other Countries:

1) If you reside in a country without specific "fair use" or "fair dealing" provisions, it is advised to only record non-copyrighted videos.

2) Alternatively, you may seek permission from the copyright holder before recording any copyrighted material.

**Please exercise caution and diligence by researching and understanding the copyright laws applicable in your region.**
