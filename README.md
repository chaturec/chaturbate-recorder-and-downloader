## ChatuRec Frequently Asked Questions

## ChatuRec Tips

Please note that you cannot initiate 10 concurrent live stream recordings if your internet speed supports only 5 concurrent streams. It's essential to monitor the recording speed and refer to our FAQ section for guidance on optimizing your recording settings. Otherwise, you risk having unwatchable videos due to running too many concurrent recordings. Additionally, please consider this when setting the "Automatically record" button for too many performers. Furthermore, please refrain from using VPN (Virtual Private Network) software while using our software, as video streaming platform may block requests.

## ChatuRec Legal Status

Our streaming recorder software does not technically violate any law. Of course, it neither intends to infringe on copyright, and it has guidelines for legal use, advertising itself as lawful. The software exercises "fair use", "fair dealing", and "private copying exception" laws, depending on the jurisdiction.

It operates on the same principles as traditional video cassette recorders (VCRs) or digital video recorders (DVRs) but for online content. Just like a VCR allows users to record and save television broadcasts for personal use, our streaming recorder enables users to capture and store streaming content from online platforms.

Much like the time-shifting feature of VCRs, our software allows users to time-shift their viewing experience by recording content for later consumption. Users can record streaming videos for personal use, such as watching at a more convenient time or storing favorite content for future enjoyment.

It's important to highlight that the software is intended for personal use, and users should respect copyright laws. Our software is designed to empower users to manage their digital content in a manner similar to traditional recording devices, promoting convenience and flexibility while respecting the rights of content creators and copyright holders.

To read more about streaming video recorders, and if they are allowed, please check here:
https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/you-can-record-movies-off-netflix-or-music-off-spotify-but-youre-not-allowed-to/

An important quote what Consumer Reports say about it is: "These services don’t technically break the law because they aren’t doing anything that circumvents the digital rights management on the video and audio being recorded."

Please be aware that ChatuRec is not accountable for the media content you record. Therefore, we strongly recommend checking the copyright laws applicable in your country and adhering to legal guidelines for video recording.

## Legal Video Recording Guidelines

If you want to legally record online videos, please read this important information.

### Legal Considerations

1) Recording copyrighted videos for personal use is generally allowed under "fair use", "fair dealing", or "private copying exception" laws, depending on the jurisdiction.

2) In certain situations, it may also be legal to record copyrighted videos for commercial purposes if those purposes fall under "fair use."

3) While recording streaming content might breach a website's terms of service, there have been no reported cases of users facing bans or legal issues solely for this practice.

It is important to note that while the ChatuRec service supports lawful recording of non-copyrighted videos, users should exercise caution and diligence to verify the copyright status of the content they record. For copyrighted material, users are advised to obtain proper authorization or ensure their actions comply with "fair use", "fair dealing", or "private copying exception" laws, as applicable. This will help maintain compliance with copyright regulations and respect for intellectual property rights.

### Fair Use, Fair Dealing, Private Copying Exception and Timeshifting

1) We believe that recording content from video-sharing websites to watch it at another time or on a device without an internet connection serves the same purpose as timeshifting and should be considered fair use, fair dealing, or fall under private copying exceptions, depending on the jurisdiction.

2) This principle aligns with the precedent set in the Betamax case, which established that recording non-copyrighted videos is entirely legal and that timeshifting for personal use can be a lawful practice under applicable laws.

### ChatuRec Service - A modern VCR for Streaming Video

1) The ChatuRec service functions as a modern VCR ("videocassette recorder") for streaming video, allowing users to make their own recordings for private, non-commercial purposes, in compliance with fair use, fair dealing, and private copying exception laws.

2) Recording copyrighted videos for viewing at a more convenient time is permitted by United States copyright law as fair use (See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 1984, the "Sony Betamax Case").

3) Recording copyrighted videos for viewing in a more convenient place is also considered fair use (See Recording Indus. Ass’n of Am. v. Diamond Multimedia Sys., Inc., 180 F.3d 1072, 1999).

4) Users are free to record non-copyrighted videos for personal use, but they should be mindful of copyright status and adhere to local laws.

### Global Fair Use, Fair Dealing, and Private Copying Exception Provisions

1) Over 45 countries, representing a significant portion of the world's population, have incorporated fair use, fair dealing, or private copying exception provisions into their copyright laws. 

2) It is crucial to be aware of the copyright laws applicable in your country before engaging in any recording activities.

3) We are unable to monitor compliance with "fair use", "fair dealing", or "private copying exception" laws in all countries; therefore, it is advisable to verify the applicable regulations in your specific country.

### Legal Status in Different Countries

Countries with "Fair Use", "Fair Dealing", or "Private Copying Exception" Laws:

1) **United States**, **United Kingdom**, and Similar Jurisdictions: In countries like the USA and UK, "fair use" or "fair dealing" laws may allow recording copyrighted videos for personal use under specific circumstances, such as for time-shifting or space-shifting purposes. Ensure compliance with local laws when exercising these rights.

2) Countries with Private Copying Exceptions: In countries such as **Germany**, **Switzerland**, **Netherlands**, **Canada**, **Austria**, **Spain**, **France**, **Belgium**, **Poland**, and the **Czech Republic**, private copying of copyrighted material for personal use might be permissible under certain conditions. Please consult your local laws to confirm the scope of "private copying exception" in your region.

Other Countries:

1) Jurisdictions Without Specific Exceptions: If you reside in a country that does not recognize "fair use", "fair dealing", or "private copying exception" it is recommended to limit recording to non-copyrighted videos.

2) Obtaining Permission: Alternatively, you can contact the copyright holder to seek explicit permission before recording any copyrighted material.

**Please exercise caution and diligence by researching and understanding the copyright laws applicable in your region.**
