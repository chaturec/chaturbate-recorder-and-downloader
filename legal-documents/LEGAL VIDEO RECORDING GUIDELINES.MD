If you want to legally record online videos, please read this important information.

**Legal Considerations**

1) Recording copyrighted videos for personal use is generally allowed under "fair use", "fair dealing", or "private copying exception" laws, depending on the jurisdiction.

2) In certain situations, it may also be legal to record copyrighted videos for commercial purposes if those purposes fall under "fair use."

3) While recording streaming content might breach a website's terms of service, there have been no reported cases of users facing bans or legal issues solely for this practice.

It is important to note that while the ChatuRec service supports lawful recording of non-copyrighted videos, users should exercise caution and diligence to verify the copyright status of the content they record. For copyrighted material, users are advised to obtain proper authorization or ensure their actions comply with "fair use", "fair dealing", or "private copying exception" laws, as applicable. This will help maintain compliance with copyright regulations and respect for intellectual property rights.

**Fair Use, Fair Dealing, Private Copying Exception and Timeshifting**

1) We believe that recording content from video-sharing websites to watch it at another time or on a device without an internet connection serves the same purpose as timeshifting and should be considered fair use, fair dealing, or fall under private copying exceptions, depending on the jurisdiction.

2) This principle aligns with the precedent set in the Betamax case, which established that recording non-copyrighted videos is entirely legal and that timeshifting for personal use can be a lawful practice under applicable laws.

**Global Fair Use, Fair Dealing, and Private Copying Exception Provisions**

1) Over 45 countries, representing a significant portion of the world's population, have incorporated fair use, fair dealing, or private copying exception provisions into their copyright laws. 

2) It is crucial to be aware of the copyright laws applicable in your country before engaging in any recording activities.

3) We are unable to monitor compliance with "fair use", "fair dealing", or "private copying exception" laws in all countries; therefore, it is advisable to verify the applicable regulations in your specific country.
