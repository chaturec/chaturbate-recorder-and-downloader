**DMCA Compliance:**

We are committed to complying with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Our streaming video recorder software operates in full accordance with DMCA provisions to protect the rights of content creators.

**Fair Use and Time-Shifting:**

Our software is designed for the purpose of time-shifting, allowing users to record streaming videos for personal, non-commercial use. Time-shifting is generally considered permissible under fair use or fair dealing laws, as it enables users to consume content at a more convenient time. We respect the legal rights of copyright holders and emphasize the importance of using our software within the boundaries of applicable laws.

It's important to note that recording videos without copyright protection or infringing content is entirely legal. Our software is intended to empower users to capture and enjoy their favorite content in a manner that adheres to all legal standards. Alternatively, it is advisable to obtain explicit permission from the copyright holder before recording any copyrighted material, especially if not permitted by "fair use" or "fair dealing" law.
